# CMD: Co-analyzed IoT Malware Detection and Forensics via Network and Hardware Domains

![avatar](./fig/overview.png)

## Introduction

CMD is a co-analyzed IoT malware detection and forensics system that combines network and hardware perspectives. 
From network-side traffic identification, CMD realizes to capture contextual semantics from cross-sources flows. 
From the host-side SPI traces analysis, CMD achieves a side-channel-manner log recovery for on-chip operations. 
This anonymous repository shows part source code including the model architecture and file operation recovery process implementation. 

## Requirements

```bash
pip install scipy
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install tqdm
pip install pyecharts
pip install joblib
pip install pickle
pip install sklearn
```

## Hardware

- W25Q128FV Flash chip: [W25Q128FV Datasheet](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/W25Q128FV.pdf)

## Running

The feature production is stored in ./traffic_iden/feature_map.py. 

The model architecture is stored in ./traffic_iden/cap_model.py. 

The code of flash data processing is stored in ./flash_processing/. 

The code of log recovery is stored in ./log_recovery/. 

The ./malware_demo/ stores some malware scripts and binary. 

## Model Interpretability

- Captum: [Captum: Model Interpretability for PyTorch](https://captum.ai/)
  - e.g., Attribution map

## Interpretability Instances

The attribution matrix generation refers to the Integrated Gradients method from Captum. 

The ./eval/png/ stores some interpretability cases for multi-stage malware infection.
